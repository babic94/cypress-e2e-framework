# Cypress E2E Automation – Conduit App

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is an **End-to-End test automation framework** built with **Cypress** for the **Conduit (RealWorld) application** by Bondar Academy.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate:
- practical Cypress usage
- real-world test scenarios (not demo examples)
- maintainable test structure suitable for team environments

This repository is intended as a **portfolio project** for QA Automation roles.

## 🧪 Application Under Test
- **UI:** https://conduit.bondaracademy.com
- **API:** https://conduit-api.bondaracademy.com

The application simulates a real blogging platform with authentication, articles, likes, feeds, and user settings.

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **Cypress** (E2E testing)
- **JavaScript**
- **Node.js / npm**

## ✅ Test Coverage
The test suite covers the following key flows:

- 🔐 User authentication (sign in / sign out)
- 📰 Article creation, validation, and deletion
- ❤️ Likes and tags functionality
- 🧾 Global and personal feed validation
- ⚙️ User settings update

Both **UI interactions** and **API-based actions** are used where appropriate to improve test speed and reliability.

---

## 🔁 Custom Commands
Reusable logic is abstracted into custom Cypress commands:
- `apiRegister()` – registers a new user via API
- `apiLogin()` – logs in via API and stores JWT token in localStorage

This approach reduces UI dependency and speeds up test execution.

## ▶️ How to Run the Tests

### 1️⃣ Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 2️⃣ Open Cypress Test Runner
```bash
npx cypress open
```

### 3️⃣ Run tests headlessly
```bash
npx cypress run
```

## 🧠 Notes
- `node_modules` is intentionally excluded from the repository
- Selectors are centralized for easier maintenance
- The project structure follows common industry practices
